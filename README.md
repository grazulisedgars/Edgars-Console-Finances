# Edgars-Console-Finances

## Description 

Front-End Development Bootcamps' fourth assignment - Console Finances. To start with we received a starter code that contained var finances with a two dimensional array: string and a number. 
We had to write functions to organise this data in a way that was necessary for the assignment. 

Total number of months was pretty easy as we had to console.log finances.length.

Afterwards I need to thank our teacher Dan Mueller who helped us work out the code in the last JavaScript lesson. For the rest of the assignment I reffered back to his code. He put the code snippets in the slack channel and I referred back to them. 

The average of changes code snippet was not full from Dan so I had to do some research. For example .toFixed(2) to round the average number to two decimal points. I found the code here:

Dan provided us with greatest increase in profits code. 
The greatest decrease code is pretty much the same with small changes.

## Comments 

Overall, I still find JavaScript quite complicated. I still need to practice it A LOT!!!
